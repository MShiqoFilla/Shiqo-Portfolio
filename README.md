# Data Engineering Portfolio

Greetings! Here I want to share some of my personal works related to data engineering. I have some skills in operating technologies like Python programming language, Relational databases (Postgresql, etc), and workflow orchestrator like Apache Airflow. I hope this page is able to showcase my ability in this topic and records my essential self development throughout the learning processes.

### Bukabuku.com Books Data ETL Pipeline

It's a web scrapping project to get the data of the books that are listed in an online bookstore bukabuku.com. Some of the data includes the title, author, language, pages, price of the book, etc. I built a simple pipeline with Airflow to automate the works from extracting data from the website, transform it, and store it to local postgresql database.
- Technologies: *Python (beautifulsoup, pandas), Apache Airflow, Docker, Postgresql*.
- Final Results: Database and csv file containing books data from bukabuku.com.
