# Data Engineering Portfolio

Here I want to share some of my personal works related to data engineering. I have some skills in operating technologies like Python programming language, Relational databases (Postgresql, etc), and workflow orchestrator like Apache Airflow. I hope this page is able to showcase my ability in this topic and records my essential self development throughout the learning processes.
